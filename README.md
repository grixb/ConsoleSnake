# Console Snake

This is a `dotnet` project for practicing and fun :) 

## Build

Before, pleas install [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).  
Then after:

```shell
cd ConsoleSnake
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Snake
```

## Why

Because I wanted to get some experience with the [command-line-api](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/tree/main)
